## Hobby Projects


#### [Antumbra](https://github.com/hanyangl5/antumbra)


yet another render framework for graphics programming.

#### [Horizon](https://github.com/hanyangl5/horizon)


![](https://github.com/hanyangl5/horizon/blob/main/docs/figs/samples/atmosphere.png?raw=true)

horizon is a real time rendering engine for my graduation project. It is for implementing real time atmospheric scattering effect.

precomputed atmospheric scattering.

rhi abstraction of Vulkan with async compute & transfer, auto pipeline layout generation, and efficient resource binding model.

physically based rendering workflow consist of the lighting, shading, and camera exposure. 

several other rendering effects, e.g. Image-Based Lighing, TAA, SSAO, HBAO, Tone Mapping.


#### [OpenGL-Renderer](https://github.com/hanyangl5/OpenGL-Renderer)


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanyangl5/Dredgen-gl/main/resources/figs/ex3_224.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAACA5MFHX6OLSYPUXLRRYQSJAZDF44UQ)

Dredgen-gl is a real time renderer based on OpenGL. Implemented deferred shading pipeline, physically based shading, real time shadowing algorithm, shadow mapping, percentage closer filtering.
integrated imgui for mesh import and scene editing.


#### [soft-renderer](https://github.com/hanyangl5/soft-renderer)

Soft Renderer is a cross-platform implementation of the GPU rendering pipeline on CPU.


#### [Astral](https://github.com/hanyangl5/Astral)

A tiny ray tracer followed by the tutorial "Ray Tracing in One Weekend Series".

#### Trick Game

Developed a puzzle-solving game for CIGA Game Jam 2022, responsible for gameplay programming with Unity.

#### ECG-based Atrial Fibrillation Rhythm Recognition

Applied several machine learning method to detect atrial fibrillation rhythm based on RR interval data from electrocardiograms, achieved over 95% accuracy on test dataset. Second price in Jiangsu Province Biomedical Innovative Design Competition.

#### [TTSR](https://github.com/Luciferbobo/TTSR_b2)

A team work project of machine learning course. made improvements to an image super-resolutoin method using transformer neural network and enhanced attension mechanism. Improved performance in PSNR an SSIM.

#### [Marvel Knowledge Graph](https://github.com/hanyangl5/Marvel_KG)

A team work project of knowledge graph course. Constructed a knowledge graph for Marvel heros using data from Wikipedia and Baidu. Implemented functions includes Entity Query, Knowledge Question Answering, Knowledge Fusion, etc.

#### [Mesh Local Roughness Computation](https://github.com/hanyangl5/MeshLocalRoughness)

![](https://github.com/hanyangl5/MeshLocalRoughness/raw/main/figs/venus.png)

Created a program that calculates and visualizes the local roughness of a 3D mesh to identify tumor regions within a scanned model of a human organ.
