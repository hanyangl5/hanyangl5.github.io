## Project

#### [Antumbra](https://github.com/hanyangl5/antumbra)

TBD

#### [Horizon](https://github.com/v4vendeta/horizon)

horizon is a real time rendering engine for my graduation project. It is for implementing real time atmospheric scattering effect.

rhi abstraction of Vulkan with async compute & transfer, auto pipeline layout generation, and efficient resource binding model.

physically based rendering workflow consist of the lighting, shading, and camera exposure. 

precomputed atmospheric scattering.

several other rendering effects, e.g. Image-Based Lighing, Shadow Mapping, TAA, SSAO, Tone Mapping.

#### [Dredgen-gl](https://github.com/v4vendeta/Dredgen-gl)

Dredgen-gl is a real time renderer based on OpenGL, Implemented deferred shading pipeline, physically based shading, real time shadowing algorithm, shadow mapping and percentage closer filtering.
integrated imgui for mesh import and scene editing.

#### [soft-renderer](https://github.com/v4vendeta/soft-renderer)

soft-renderer implemented some graphcis pipeline stage. e.g, Vertex transformation, back face culling, scanline rasterization with perspective correct interpolation. Phong shading and texture filtering.

#### [tiny ray tracer](https://github.com/hanyangl5/tiny-ray-tracer)

A tiny ray tracer followed by the tutorial "Ray Tracing in One Weekend Series" and smallpt.

#### [Trick Game](https://github.com/hanyangl5/CIGA-2022-TRICK)

Developed a puzzle-solving game for CIGA Game Jam 2022, responsible for gameplay programming with Unity.

#### [ECG-based Atrial Fibrillation Rhythm Recognition]()

Applied several machine learning method to detect atrial fibrillation rhythm based on RR interval data from electrocardiograms, achieved over 95% accuracy on test dataset. Second price in Jiangsu Province Biomedical Innovative Design Competition.

#### [TTSR_b2](https://github.com/Luciferbobo/TTSR_b2)

A team work project of machine learning course. made improvements to an image super-resolutoin method using transformer neural network and enhanced attension mechanism. Improved performance in PSNR an SSIM.

#### [Marvel_KG](https://github.com/hanyangl5/Marvel_KG)

A team work project of knowledge graph course. Constructed a knowledge graph for Marvel heros using data from Wikipedia and Baidu. Implemented functions includes Entity Query, Knowledge Question Answering, Knowledge Fusion, etc.

## Misc

I am a huge fan of video games, AAA&indie&competitive&coop, currently I am falling in love with [Destiny2](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/), some game record can be found [here](games.md).

maybe some time I write [blogs](blogs.md).
