## Bio

I am Hanyang Lu, a senior student at Southeast University, major in Computer Science. I am passionated about real-time rendering techniques. Currently I am focusing on my graduation project Horizon(see below).

## Project

#### [Horizon](https://github.com/v4vendeta/horizon)

horizon is a real time rendering engine for my graduation project. it is for implementing real time atmospheric scattering effect.

#### [Dredgen-gl](https://github.com/v4vendeta/Dredgen-gl)

Dredgen-gl is a real time renderer based on OpenGL, Implemented deferred shading pipeline, physically based shading for opaque material, real time shadowing algorithm, shadow mapping and percentage closer filtering.

#### [soft-renderer](https://github.com/v4vendeta/soft-renderer)

soft-renderer consists basic elements of rendering pipeline: model loading, geometry transformation, barycentric coordinate based rasterization, Phong shading and texture mapping.

#### [Astral](https://github.com/v4vendeta/Astral)

my toy offline renderer, implemented ray casting, ray geometry intersection, recursive ray tracing.

## Misc

- I am a huge fan of video games, AAA&indie&competitive&coop, currently I am falling in love with [Destiny2](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/), some game record can be found [here](https://v4vendetalhy.cn/games)
- maybe some time I write [blogs](https://github.com/v4vendeta/v4vendeta.github.io/tree/master/post).
